In Git, the ```git-remote -v``` command returns a list of remote repositories that the current project is tied to.

Pushing Branch Changes
In Git, the ```git push origin branch-name``` command pushes the branch, and all committed changes, to the remote.

Fetching Remote Origin Changes
In Git, the ```git fetch``` command downloads objects from the origin remote repository. The changes, however, are not merged into the current branch-name branch. Instead, they are stored in the origin/branch-name branch, waiting to be merged.

In the provided example, using the ``git branch -a`` command to see the existing branches, we can see that fetched data has been stored in a new origin/master branch.
